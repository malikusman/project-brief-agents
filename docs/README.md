## Documentation

Use this space for high-level architecture notes, ADRs, and user-facing manuals.

Suggested structure:
- `adr/` — architecture decision records
- `api/` — OpenAPI specs or schema references
- `guides/` — playbooks for operating the system

We’ll flesh this out once the services are scaffolded.
